# Pihole + Kodi

(just keeping track of) Changes to pi:

## Distro

Use [Manjaro-ARM-minimal-rpi4](https://github.com/manjaro-arm/rpi4-images/releases/)
with RaspberryPi imager (would loved to use arch, however installation of arch onto SD card is a heckmeck when all you have is a windows desktop)

In RaspberryPI Imager use the magic to set:
* user+password
* wifi ssid+password
* ssh key
